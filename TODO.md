# TODO

This document describes features to be incorporated in the future.

## HIGH

- Add multi option for non-blocking requests
- Response is allocating too much unnecessary memory, make a better allocation prediction system
- Curl write callback is unsafe, it should check for size

## MEDIUM

- Bunch of unnecessary callocs, replace with mallocs

## LOW
